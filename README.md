# Rent-Bike-JS ðŸš²

## Intro

A simple node.js app that emulates a rent-bike docking station system, commonly used in cities.

This was written with TDD (Test Driven Development) approach using Jest as my testing framework.

## Installation

1. Clone or fork this repo.
2. If you do not already have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Nodes's Homepage") intsall it from thier homepage.
3. From the project root directory, run: ~ npm install
4. From the root directory, you should now be able to run test using Jest with: `~ npm test`

## Running the program

In the project root directory run: ~node
This will start the node REPL where we can begin to input commands

start by requiring the classes that we are going to use. In our case we will need DocktionStation and Bike:

```
> const DockingStation = require('./src/dockingStation')

> const Bike = require('./src/bike')
```

We then instantiate the classes (feel free to choose your own variable names), in this instance we will create 1 DockingStation and 2 Bikeâ€™s:

```
> const dock = new DockingStation()

> const bike1 = new Bike()

> const bike2 = new Bike()
```

Before docking both bikes, lets report bike1 as broken:

```
> bike1.reportBroken()

> dock.storeBike(bike1)

> dock.storeBike(bike2)
```

As you can see now our dock returns the following information:

```
> dock
DockingStation {
  brokenBikes: [ Bike { working: false } ],
  workingBikes: [ Bike { working: true } ],
  capacity: 5
}
```

Release bike should bring us back the working bike and never the broken bike:

```
> dock.releaseBike()
Bike { working: true }

> dock.releaseBike()
Uncaught 'There are no working bikes at this docking station'
```

Feel free to experiment. Remember you can create a dock with higher capacity (lets say 10) by instantiating the class like this:

```
> const dock = new DockingStation(10)
```

## User Stories

```
As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.

As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 5 bikes.

As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.

As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to report a bike as broken when I return it.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations to accept returning bikes (broken or not).
